Many different animals can create electricity, including electric eels, electric rays, oreintal hornets, and black ghost knifefish.

History of electromagnetism

Hans Christian Orsted (1777 - 1851) figured out that an electric current can produce a magnetic field.
Micheal Faraday (1791 - 1867) was a primary contributor to the discovery of electromagnetism. Faraday discovered that magnets can be used to induce electricty (electromagnetism)
Joseph Henry (1797 - 1878) was a scientist who created one of the first electromgnetic motors to ever exist. 
These three pioneers of electromagnetism layed the foudation for our current use of technology and the internet as a whole.
Human made forms of eletromagnetic fields can be transmitted through tv antennas, radio antennas, phone antennas and microwaves among many more electronic devices.

Hysteria around Electromagnetic fields 

Many people believe that man made electromagnetic fields can cause various health issues such as cancer or troubles with pregnanch and fertiliy.
Contrary to this belief, there is no correlation based in any form of scientific research that suggests that these man made electromagnetic fields can cause any form of health issues.

Telegraphs

Telegraphs are a [Medium](Medium.md) where a stylus or pen would transcibe a message when given an electric "code". This was the first and most primitive form of long distance messaging, and would later evolve into what we know as emails and text messages.
