The medium is the message

"Medium" is something that carries something else.
	We respond to messages differently depending on the medium. For example, if you were to recieve a text message of a loved one passing away, you would react to it differently if you were told this same information in person.
The medium is just as important as the message itself because of this. 
	"Classifications both relfect and direct our thinking". The way in which we classify media/messages has implications for power, control and discipline.
In short, mediums greatly effect how we percieve the message that is given to us.
