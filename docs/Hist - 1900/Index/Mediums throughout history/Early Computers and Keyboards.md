There is a special type of paper that turns darker with the contact of electricity. This paper has been used to make records and an early form of the television. You would draw a set of lines accross the treated paper which would scan a picture. This evolved into modern television when we transitioned from moving pictures to moving beams of electrons (much faster).

The vocoder is a machine where you must speak into it and it will print off your words as a transcript. This techonology would later evolve into the modern microphone and various other voice recording technologies.
