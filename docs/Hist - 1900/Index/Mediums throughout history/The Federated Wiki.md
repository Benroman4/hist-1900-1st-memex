Federated wiki

To simplify this concept, the federated wiki is a series of connected wikis created by multiple other users. Instead of tweeting something on twitter or posting a photo on instagram, you would post it to a wiki on the federated wiki. This can range from topics regarding politics to more simple day to day matters.
The federated wiki is a more advanced form of [Medium](Medium.md) used in the modern age of the internet. It provides an alternative to social media platforms where there is no dopaine reward system. People post to the federated wiki in order to blog their lives and research findings without the distraction of toxicity.
