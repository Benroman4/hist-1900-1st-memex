Some notes
- Hubbard was able to challenge Western Union's monopoly, claiming that the company was agaisnt public interest.
- Western Union was the first true monopoly over the telegraph industry, having around 90% of the market.

"Yet Western Union, Hubbard argued, was not just ignoring an untapped market, " (pg 65)

- Hubbard wanted to desolve the monopoly over the telegraph industry and make a more pro consumer system.
- Alexander Graham Bell intially wanted to create a device that would print off spoken word into a visual [Medium](Medium.md). 

Some take-aways
- This ties back to what we discussed in class, as it merely confirms that Western Union had a monopoly over the telegram industry.
- How did the eventual collapse of Western Union's monopoly affect today's current internet market?
- Western Union's communication monopoly and anti consumer practices are not too dissimilar to modern cable companies and their monopolies. Rogers and Bell can essentially charge whatever they like for their services.
