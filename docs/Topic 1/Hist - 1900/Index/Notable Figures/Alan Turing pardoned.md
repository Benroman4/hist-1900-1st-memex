Key points from the article
- Alan Turing was a codebreaker during World War II. He was succesfully able to decipher a secret german naval code that massively impacted the war effort. Turing was later discovered to be a homosexual man, which was a crime in that era. He was offered the choice of inprisonment or chemical castration, and he chose the latter. Because of this, Turing comitted suicide via cianide poisining in 1954.
- On the 24th of December, 2013, Alan Turing was offically pardoned for his "crime".

Key take-aways

- Britain rewarded the man who saved the war effort by killing him.
- This begs the question: how many other heros were unknowingly given the same treatment? The news about Turing only came to light recently, so how many other people might be suffering the same treatment?
