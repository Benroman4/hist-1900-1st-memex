"So a year ago I would have thrown the link to Twitter with a damning summary of the study, and everyone would have known I was a good liberal and retweeted it to prove that they were good liberals and if you listened closely you could hear our collective neurons harden."

- The author clearly isn't a fan of the echo chambers that twitter can produce.

	"And I get really excited, because I remember the Suicide Belt article I wrote six months ago, and realize that would be a perfect link. So I link to it and read it again. And what I’m trying to do now is think about what sentence I put in front of the link. I’m thinking about how I define the relation."

- Not to dissimilar to our memexes, the author is drawing connections between different articles he's written, something that twitter cannot accomplish on its own.

	"And when you get to that point, where you’ve mapped out 1000s of articles of your own knowledge you start to see impacts on your thought that are very hard to describe."

- The author is showing how the federated wiki can make connections between thousands of different thoughts that you otherwise would never be able to make.

	"And so we come to the question of whether we are at a turning point. Do we see a rebirth of garden technologies in the present day?"

- This bring up an excellent question. could annotative tecnologies become even more popular? How will these tecnologies and websites influence the academic scene?
