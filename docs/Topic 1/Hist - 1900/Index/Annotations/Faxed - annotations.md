"Compared with a conventional telegram, preparing a fax message took more time, effort and materials such as metallic paper and special ink . The sender did not simply dash off a note and hand it to the telegraph clerk but wrote it with insulating ink on a metallic paper " (Coopersmith,  )

- Fax machines were a lot more inconvienient to use and construct compared to a telegraph. Most new technolgies face this issue. This directly relates to [Early Computers and Keyboards](Early%20Computers%20and%20Keyboards.md) as they faced this same issues.

	"Bain was the first to devise a practical system. Compared to other systems, his chemical telegraph did not need electromagnets to make and break contact or needles to indicate letters" (Coopersmith, 13)

- Bain invented a chemical telegraph system which revolutionized telegraphs and digital communication. All of his hard work was essentially bought out by larger corporations.

	"Bain's failiures were threefold: ideas in advance of the enabling technologies of the time, being not a commerical man and personal shortcomings" (Coopersmith, 17)

- Bain faced the same issues as many other independent inventors of his time, as he was too ahead of his time and did not have the resources to fully realize his creations.
