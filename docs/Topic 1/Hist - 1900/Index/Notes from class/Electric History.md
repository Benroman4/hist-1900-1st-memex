Many different animals can create electricity, including electric eels, electric rays, oreintal hornets, and black ghost knifefish.

History of electromagnetism

- Hans Christian Orsted (1777 - 1851) figured out that an electric current can produce a magnetic field.
- Micheal Faraday (1791 - 1867) was a primary contributor to the discovery of electromagnetism. Faraday discovered that magnets can be used to induce electricty (electromagnetism)
- Joseph Henry (1797 - 1878) was a scientist who created one of the first electromgnetic motors to ever exist. 
- These three pioneers of electromagnetism layed the foudation for our current use of technology and the internet as a whole.
- Human made forms of eletromagnetic fields can be transmitted through tv antennas, radio antennas, phone antennas and microwaves among many more electronic devices.

Telegraphs

- Telegraphs are a [Medium](Medium.md) where a stylus or pen would transcibe a message when given an electric "code".
