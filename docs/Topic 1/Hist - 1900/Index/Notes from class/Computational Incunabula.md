Colossus
- Developed during WWII.
- Emerges from the Bombe.
- Never fully declassified until well after the war.
- Superveining necessity: German wolfpack.
- Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads the design of Colossus.
- Colossus could suggest best match for a pattern within a text.
- Second colossus could figure out which pattern was best to try.

Project whirlwind
- Started off as a flight simulation computer for a vareity of planes during the war.
- It was the most expensive project, and as a result the navy lost interest.
- Airforce takes over: the only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers.
- Solves the problem of magnetic memory.

Meanwhile in Britain
- Mancester Baby was being developed (computer)
- Built to test another solution to the problem of memory.
- Runs a stored program from memory in 1948.

Allies no longer shring information
- Act of congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work.
- Britain sets out to build its own expertise.
- Decides that all such experiements ought to be centralised at the National Physical Laboratory.
- The official British computer will be built at NPL, and they turn to Turing to make it.

The Death of Alan Turing
- Turing moves to Manchester to work on computing 1948.
- His house is burgled; he calls the police. In the course of their investigation, Turing is forced to admist that he is homosexual, 1952.
- He was found guilty of gross indecency: imprisionment or probation with chemical castration.
- Loses security clearances, chooses castration.
- Committs suicide in 1954.
- Turing was pardoned in 2012.
- See [Alan Turing pardoned](Alan%20Turing%20pardoned.md) for further detail.

The Period of the Digital incunabula is over
- In the Uk, commerical versions of the Manchester Baby are being sold by the Ferranti corporation as general purpose buisness computers by 1951.
- By 1952, IAS machine comes online.
- The digital age begins.
- "There will never be enough problems, enough computers... stop this foolishness with Eckert and Mauchly" - Aitken.

Programming still an issue
- Every computer has its own wiring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies.
- People like Grace Hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some interperability. 
- Mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were.
