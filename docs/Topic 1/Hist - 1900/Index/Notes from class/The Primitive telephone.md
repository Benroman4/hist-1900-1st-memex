- When tension was applied to the wire the recipient would be able to hear the other person.

Follow the money
- This discovery implied serious money to be made.
- Different signals, frequency and notes could be sent down one individual wire.
- The development of the string phone, megaphone, speaking tubes, ear trumps, sound resonators and the wave theory of electromagnetism sprung from this.

Variable resistance
- M Clarac, french telepgraph offical, found tubes with powered carbon could be put under pressure, the amount of electrical resistance could be regulated through that pressure.
- Kelvin had earlier shown that resistance to electricity in a wire could be modified by putting the wire under tension.
