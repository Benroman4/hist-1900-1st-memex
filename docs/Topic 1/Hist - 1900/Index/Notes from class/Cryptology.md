Cryptology and Cryptoanalysis

- Cryptology are the systems for a secret writing or "code".
- Crytoanalysis are the systems for revealing secrets codes.

Polybius square (c200 - c118 BC)

- A polybius square is one of the earliest forms of cryptology. 
- When you are given a polybius square, it will be a 5 x 5 grid with the alphabet filling the grid. Every letter of the alphabet is assigned to a set of coordinates (ex:1,5 = T). The code will written out as: 127980976 and you must decipher it using the grid.

Caesar shift

- A casesar shift is another form of cryptology. In order to make a caesar shift, you would write out the entire alphabet and shift every letter over by 5 places.
- This form of cryptology was first used by Julius Caesar around 100 BC. 
- Julius Caesar would typically use this form of cryptology to discreetly communicate with his generals. 

Bi literal cipher

- The biliteral or "bacon" cipher was created by Francis Bacon (1561 - 1626) in 1623. 
- A bi literal cipher hides a secret message in a text. It accomplishes this by representing the secret letters and message as a form of binary coding. 

How to decript

- You typically decript the letter "e" first, since it is the most common letter in the alphabet.
