- The first Bell company was founded in 1875.

- The first telephone exchange was operated by western Union's telephone subsidery.

- Unique phone number only became a concept in 1879.

- For the first two decades of telephony the uptake was extremly slow, as this was an entirely new tecnology. The US received this tecnology first.

- The first iteration of the telephone was very suseptible to interceptions. These interceptions include thunderstorms, telegraph wires and trolleys.

- When competition arose, Bell cut their costs in specific areas in order to compete. These competitors refused to interconnect with Bell's networks.

- Bell labs was the pinnacle of reasearch during this era. Using the mass ampunt of funding that Bell received, Claude Shannon was able to prove that electrical circuits can run logical operations, and thus the computer was invented. 

- Claude Shannon eventually came up with the information theory. 

- To summarize this series of events, Bell was able to patent various tecnologies in order to keep their monopoly over the telephone industry. Using the money they aquired from this monopoly, Bell Labs was able to research whatever new technologies they wanted to.
